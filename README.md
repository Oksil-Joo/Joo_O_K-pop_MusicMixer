This is Oksilâ€™s Audio Mixer of K-pop. I created an audio Mixer based on the Java Script. The theme of my Audio Mixer is **My Favorite Korean Musics**.

### To run
The index.html file must be executed to execute the music play.

### Reason for Application
An audio mixer was produced to demonstrate the drag, drop, drag start learning in a Multimedia Authoring class.

### Videos Sources
